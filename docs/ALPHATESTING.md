# Alpha Testing Guide 

## Required Accounts 
You will need both a GitHub and a Discord account to best assist with the Alpha Testing process.

## Installing the apps

For Apple users, you will receive an invitation to download TestFlight from the Apple Store and a redemption code to access the app alpha within TestFlight.
For Android users, You will receive an email with how to install the app upon it being lodged in the Play Store - currently, we still await Google's approval.

## Using the app

Once the app is installed on your device and you start it up, you'll be presented with a login page. All you need to so is enter you name and your public and private keys will be generated for you. These will be stored on your device and will be used to make votes. **Note:** At this stage, your keys can NOT be transferred to another device.

You can browse both the Bills and Issues tabs, navigate to the voting section and make votes. Your vote should be updated into the results within 10 minutes.

## Bug reporting

To lodge a detailed BUG report, go to the [Issues Page](https://github.com/voteflux/voting_app/issues) on the **voting_app** repo. Check if your issue/bug type has been mentioned and add to it *OR* create a new issue. 
**NOTE:** Be sure to use the *alpha feedback* tag when creating a new issue. You may also add appropriate tags.

From there, to discuss bugs and issues with the first alpha, head over to the [Flux Discord Server](https://discord.gg/xFMUTZw) and join in the **#alpha_testers** channel. Post screenshots and write descriptions of your findings.
